# Codility Solutions
> This repository contains my solutions to codility excercises and challenges.
## Motivation
While solutions to codility excercises are abundant in the web, 
I have realized that basically none of them actually try to explain the solution and go a little into detail in the topics of 
algorithmics that they relate to. This is the focus of this repositry.

**what I am not trying to do:**

Present the fastest possible solution. The focus is to give an understanding of the problem and present a solution, 
while diving into some topics of algorithmics.
